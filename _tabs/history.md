# History 

Super, is story time. This blog started on ***digitalmonkey.gr*** domain with tutorials around computer stuff and more focused on Windows OS. Was meant to be read by Greeks so it was written in Greek language only.

Just checked [WaybackMachine](https://archive.org){:target="_blank"} (yeah there is a site that archives all sites) and it has 4 snapshots of that old blog (yeah only 4 unfortunately) so we will assume that blog started in the year of 2007 ([Snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20071027092230/http://www.digitalmonkey.gr/){:target="_blank"}). I might have started it way before that but because of my bad memory will stay with the facts :blush: 
)

The blog live for a year or two. Yes people was reading It (yes i had viewers doh), also i had people who went and `stole` the contents as is and introduced them in their sites or in forums as their own. This is how i recognized that my content was good or missing ,in general, from the internet. Looks like people would search to learn or find a solution to their problems or even find a different opinion on something they already know. This is a good sign that people still `reading` blogs and not only watching videos to learn things (the likes of youtube videos). While stealing content by copy pasting an exact match on your site/forums isn't good, it is acceptable when you include the source and give kudos to the content creator.
