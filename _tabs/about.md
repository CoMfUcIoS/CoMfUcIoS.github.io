## My Blog's story

Are you ready to listen to a story ? I used to have a blog on ***digitalmonkey.gr*** domain with tutorials around various stuff but more focused on Windows and internet of things. It was written also only in Greek, no English whatsoever 

Just checked the [WaybackMachine](https://archive.org) (yeah there is a site that archives all sites) and it has 4 snapshots of my blog (yeah only 4) so we will assume that my blog started in the year of 2007 ([Snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20071027092230/http://www.digitalmonkey.gr/)). I might have started it way before that but because of my bad memory will stay with the way back machine facts :D
