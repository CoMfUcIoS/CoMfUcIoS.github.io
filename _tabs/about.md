This blog is a small corner in the chaotic internet space! It is for those romantic developers/readers who wants to read instead of watching a video in YouTube. Don't get me wrong, vlogs are here to stay but not my thing and i believe there are other people out there that wants to read instead of watch.

The format of this blog will be a variety of things i do or i discover in my daily developer/tinkerer life with a sense of a tutorial/work through. You would expect content about Technology, software engineering, Home lab stuff, Hardware etc and even silly things that encounter everyday which after a bit of research i was able to overcome. Those might be those little things that we face everyday and we spent 30 minutes researching to figure out how to solve them. Can be anything and not tech related at all. 

I used to have a blog and the content was tutorials in a more formal writing (If you like to know more about it please visit the [history](/history) tab) but this is long gone (erased) and i think a less formal way of approaching things its more friendlier and funnier to read and write :).

I hope you enjoy my content and please don't forget that you can make some requests by sending me a message either through email or from any social media. Of course you can also comment on my posts anything that i wrote wrong or misunderstood so you can make me better and also the content of my blog.

See you on my next post then and happy reading,

Ioannis K.
