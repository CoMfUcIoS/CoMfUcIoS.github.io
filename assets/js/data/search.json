Yeah, a shell is a program that processes commands and outputs the results! You can interact with a shell through the server console! But if your server is in your basement without a keyboard and a monitor??? Then you use a terminal to emulate the console which runs the shell! Confused already? Simples… Shell is a layer that sits on top of a kernel and to interact with it we need to be physically at the console! If we aren’t, we can connect remotely to it by using a terminal ( also known as terminal emulator ) which emulates the console where you interact with the shell. Some people say the word terminal and get away with it :smiley:. Now if you wanna know what the word cloud is, I have already written a blog post of that fancy word go check it out :smiley: The Cloud is upon us. I don’t think I need to explain to you what google is :joy:What is Google Cloud Shell tho?I thought you will never ask :stuck_out_tongue:. I will use what google says about it Cloud Shell is an online development and operations environment accessible anywhere with your browser. That said, it is a Virtual machine that you can access through your browser!!! You can have a terminal and an editor similar to vscode ( its theia editor ) on your browser!! It’s a virtual machine running in the cloud!!! And yes, now you own one for free if you haven’t had any before :grin:How can I use it?If you are a developer you already using the terminal and your favourite IDE to do almost everything, right? Those two are provided by GCS for free and are accessible from your browser. FROM ANYWHERE! If you don’t like the provided IDE, you can also use neovim/vim with your configuration and plugins ( yay ) without any problems directly from the terminal ( i might write another post on how to install neovim on GCS). And that freedom doesn’t end there… you can also download the mobile apps and you can do the same thing while on the go. Of course, you don’t need the app, you can still use your favourite mobile browser :wink:. Goes without saying that you can do everything that you can do on a physical machine you have at home running Debian. I am currently using it right now to write this very blog post ( and the previous posts )! All I needed to have was a google account ( ehm its obvious right?).But is it fast?Hmmm, define fast! When this blog post was written the virtual machine had Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.20GHz 4 Core and 16GB of ram running Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye). Good enough for a medium development environment if you ask meHow much does it costs?It is free… Ok ok, not completely free but you are given a usage quota of 50 hours per week and that is even enough to work daily for 8 hours and you would be left with 10 hours for the weekend :nerd_face:.Ok, what’s the catch?Well, you cant host your 24/7 app on that. You only have 50 hours of free usage, buy an actual VM for 24/7. Also, Google provides you 5 GB of storage and those are only allocated at your /home folder. You can install/store anything anywhere ( you also have sudo permissions ) but won’t be preserved on the VM because it will be deleted when you stop using it. Next time you will open your Cloud Shell again, you will get a fresh new Debian VM with only your /home/ folder persistent. So whatever you install/download and want to keep it persistent, store it in your home folder. Good thing is that comes with a lot of libraries for developing with the most languages pre-installed.Right, you still haven’t told us how to get it?Oh sorry about that, let’s fix it… All you need is a google account (doh) and visit shell.cloud.google.com. That’s it! Enter GCS. You will be welcomed with a terminal ( after initialization ) and with some icons on the top right. The first one is the IDE ( theia ), the second is a terminal ( you can have a terminal in the IDE anyway), the third one is to open a port you want and open a browser to that port and on the third one you can see your usage quota! I will let you investigate every other icon over there but you will easily understand them. Here you can see a screenshot of my IDE right now while I m writing this very post.Wait is that git and Jekyll?Yes exactly what I do now. I cloned my blog repository in GCS and started writing this post. After I finish it I will push it to my repo from GCS and let my Github action do the rest to publish it. As I said before, you can use whatever app is available to Debian aptitude repositories and GCS comes with a lot of development libraries and tools pre-installed.New home you said?Yeah, I might need to rephrase that! It’s my new REMOTE home! It is accessible from anywhere and I have everything there for me ready as I left them. Or are one git command away to get them if I was using my physical machine at home. It is convenient and it is free! I like it but I would prefer to be able to add some vscode extension goodies to the IDE which now you can’t…. but I use Neovim with my configuration and plugins to everything else but the blog.Are you ever going to conclude?I haven’t even scratched the surface of what you can do with GCS. I don’t even use it for what it was built for. I will let you conquer it with your use cases and let me know in the comments how you are using it. For now, I am using it as my remote go-to machine. My remote home. I write this very blog there and I am having a great experience with it. I haven’t the need to pay for it yet but if I need to I might go for it. I think it is pay per hour used so it won’t cost a tonne of money either :smiley:I hope I haven’t tired you with my excitement but I thought it is a good share for some,Keep it !false and have fun~ Giannis~" }, { "title": "The `Cloud` is upon us", "url": "/posts/the-cloud-is-upon-us/", "categories": "fancy words", "tags": "lifestyle, fancy words, blog", "date": "2022-03-03 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "The CloudFancy technology words!

Will it rain bytes? Brace yourselves, a storm is coming.Some will say it's someone else machine and while this is accurate let’s make it simpler than that. It’s the internet!!!! Yeap THE internet! If you have ever witnessed ( pun intended ) a network flowchart, the internet is always displayed as a cloud with the word internet inside! Soooo…. the word cloud is a metaphor for the internet and the way people display them in their flowcharts and presentations. If you still want an encyclopedia definition then here it is \"hardware and software services from a provider on the internet.\".But Giannis …. how do I use da Cloud?Oh, you use it already. Yes, even right now! Every time you visit any website ( and when I say ANY … I mean ANY ) you are being served by a machine ( virtual or physical ) in the cloud. That might be in a big farm of servers in a data centre ( those horrifying cold and dark rooms with blinky led lights ) or from a small machine like raspberry pi or Arduino in someone’s barn/garage!!! Even my blog is hosted from a server that is owned/used by github.com! Those machines [insert Terminator theme music in the background] are up and running 24/7. And if they fail, others will replace waiting to take their place instantly (backup) so a blog or anything that they serve has minimum downtime. I am also writing this very blog post in the cloud on a virtual machine provided by Google.That was it?Yes, that is, for now, a simple explanation of what the cloud is. Now, my next blog post will be on how to use the cloud for your development environment. Yes you can do that too and it is free ( almost free :stuck_out_tongue:) but this is for another time and another blog post.Till the rain come down from those black clouds that gather above me,Keep it !false and have fun~ Giannis~" }, { "title": "Blog's story", "url": "/posts/blogs-story/", "categories": "news", "tags": "news, blog, lifestyle", "date": "2021-10-24 00:00:00 +0100", "snippet": "Super, is storytime.

This blog started on digitalmonkey.gr domain with tutorials around computer stuff and more focused on Windows OS. Was meant to be read by Greeks so it was written in the Greek language only.Just checked WaybackMachine (yeah there is a site that archives all sites) and it has 4 snapshots of that old blog (yeah only 4 unfortunately) so we will assume that blog started in the year of 2007 (Snapshot). I might have started it way before that but because of my bad memory will stay with the facts :blush:)The blog lived for a year or two. Yes, people were reading It (yes I had readers doh), also I had people who went and stole the contents as is and introduced them in their sites or forums as their own. This is how I recognized that my content was good or missing, in general, from the internet.This is a good sign, people will search the internet to learn or find a solution to their problems or even find a different opinion on something they already know. People still reading blogs and not only watching videos to learn things (the likes of youtube videos). While stealing content isn’t good, it is acceptable when you include the source and gives kudos to the creator.My blog was hosted on a friend’s server and one sunny morning the blog disappeared. I called my friend and he told me that the hosting company who was behind the server disappeared. He also lost whatever he had on that server too. I was young and not that experienced at the time (you can also call me lazy) and I didn’t have any backups of my blog. Also, my friend didn’t have any backup/snapshots of his server. Unfortunately, we both end up with nothing from our data and had to start from scratch again. That was a wake-up call for me and since then I am always saying to myself “whatever you do, think how you will back it up and implement that first”. We also tried to contact the company and retrieve at least (at our costs) the hard drives but no one was answering any calls or emails anymore.That was it, that was the end of my very first blog and never find the ‘courage’ or time to start a new one again. Maybe I was so annoyed from losing all the content of my blog! But never say never, here I am writing a new blog. I still don’t know what the content will be on this one but I know why I started it.The idea behind this is simple. First of course I would like to share what I m doing or discovering in my everyday developer/tinkerer life and also make use of some technologies that I haven’t used enough that I wanted. For example, I am writing this very ABOUT page in NeoVim using an old Nexus 7 tablet (let’s say I will make a post of this at some point) and also, I have never used ruby on rails before and Jekyll. I hope by doing this, I will get more experience on all of this plus more.That was my blog’s history, hope I didn’t bore you to death with it. Now, let’s look to the future of this and always remember to BACK UP YOUR STUFF!" } ]
